The FiniteAutomaton class expresses a M = (Q,Σ,δ,p,F) finite automaton.
The Transition class expresses a δ(p,a) = q transition.

The ReadFA function reads the 5 properties of a finite automaton from a file and sets them into the object.
The parseTransitions and validateTransitions functions are helpers for marshalling into valid Transition objects.

The Accepts function checks if all the terminals within a sequence can be found in the FA alphabet.
If there is a character that can't be found, false is returned.
Then, we apply transitions sequentially. If there is no transition defined at a point in the sequence,
false is returned. If the final state can't be found in the FA set of final states, false is returned.
True is returned otherwise.

The FA.in file should be formatted like so:
